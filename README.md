# Keylogger
For educational purpose only
Aforementioned,this project was solely made for educational purpose,I do not claim any right for this program,I just made it based on others' work during my course.
Therefore,neither me nor the owner would allow you to use this project for any crime-possible

WHAT DOES THIS PROGRAM DO :
- Recording the keys you type on your keyboard
- Encrypting the data that you have recorded in the previous stage (it come with a decryptor of course)
- Sending mail in which contains the data based on system time modification
